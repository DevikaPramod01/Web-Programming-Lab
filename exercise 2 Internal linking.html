<p><font size="5">The term <u><b>web server</b></u> can refer to hardware or software, or both of them working together.<br>
On the hardware side, a web server is a computer that stores web server software and a website's component files (for example, HTML documents, images, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files). A web server connects to the Internet and supports physical data interchange with other devices connected to the web.<br>
On the software side, a web server includes several parts that control how web users access hosted files. At a minimum, this is an HTTP server. An HTTP server is software that understands URLs (web addresses) and HTTP (the protocol your browser uses to view webpages). An HTTP server can be accessed through the domain names of the websites it stores, and it delivers the content of these hosted websites to the end user's device.<br>
At the most basic level, whenever a browser needs a file that is hosted on a web server, the browser requests the file via HTTP. When the request reaches the correct (hardware) web server, the (software) HTTP server accepts the request, finds the requested document, and sends it back to the browser, also through HTTP. (If the server doesn't find the requested document, it returns a 404 response instead.)<br></p></font>

<p><font size="5"><u><b>A Web application (Web app)</b></u> is an application program that is stored on a remote server and delivered over the Internet through a browser interface. Web applications are delivered on the World Wide Web to users with an active network connection.All web-based database applications have three primary components: A web browser (or client), a web application server, and a database server.<br>
Web-based database applications rely on a database server, which provides the data for the application. The database server sometimes also provides business logic in the form of stored procedures. Stored procedures can offer significant performance advantages, especially in a multi-tiered architecture. In addition to database servers, other enterprise information system components include IMS databases, IBM® MQ messages, and CICS records.<br>
The clients handle the presentation logic, which controls the way in which users interact with the application. In some cases, the client validates user-provided input. Web applications sometimes integrate Java™ applets into the client-side logic to improve the presentation layer.<br></font>

<p><font size="5"><u><b>Hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS)</b></u> is the secure version of HTTP, which is the primary protocol used to send data between a web browser and a website. HTTPS is encrypted in order to increase security of data transfer. This is particularly important when users transmit sensitive data, such as by logging into a bank account, email service, or health insurance provider.<br>
Any website, especially those that require login credentials, should use HTTPS. In modern web browsers such as Chrome, websites that do not use HTTPS are marked differently than those that are. Look for a padlock in the URL bar to signify the webpage is secure. Web browsers take HTTPS seriously; Google Chrome and other browsers flag all non-HTTPS websites as not secure.<br>
HTTPS uses an encryption protocol to encrypt communications. The protocol is called Transport Layer Security (TLS), although formerly it was known as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). This protocol secures communications by using what’s known as an asymmetric public key infrastructure.<br>

<u><b>A dynamic page</b></u> displays different content for different users while retaining the same layout and design. Such pages, usually written in CGI, AJAX, ASP or ASP.NET, take more time to load than simple static pages. They’re frequently implemented to show information that changes frequently, e.g., weather updates or stock prices.<br>
Dynamic pages usually contain application programs for different services and require server-side resources like databases. A database allows the page creator to separate the website’s design from the content to be displayed to users. Once they upload content into the database, it is retrieved by the website in response to a user request.<br>
When the web server receives a user request for a dynamic page, it does not send the page directly to the requesting browser as it would do with a static page. Instead, it passes the page to the application server which then completes three activities:<br>
 <ul><li>Read the code on the page</li>
 	<li>Finish the page according to the code’s instructions</li>
  <li>Remove the code from the page</li></ul><br>
This results in a static page that’s passed back to the web server by the application server, and then to the requesting browser for display.
<br>
The application server cannot communicate directly with the database, so it requires a database driver that functions as an interpreter and lets the application read and manipulate data that would otherwise be indecipherable.
Two Types of Dynamic Web Pages<br>
Client-side Scripting: A web page that changes in response to an action within it (“client-side event”) uses client-side scripting. These scripts generate “client-side content” on the user’s computer, rather than the web server.<br>
Server-side Scripting: A web page that changes when it’s loaded or visited, or based on what’s submitted to it, uses server-side scripting. When the pages are loaded, server-side content is generated. Examples include login pages, shopping carts and submission forms.<br>

<p><font size="5"><u><b>Application Server</b></u> is a type of server designed to install, operate, and host applications.An application server is a program that resides on the server-side, and it’s a server programmer providing business logic behind any application. This server can be a part of the network or the distributed network.<br>
They are basically used in a web-based application that has 3 tier architecture. The position at which the application server fits in is described below:<br>
<ul><li>
Tier 1 – This is a GUI interface that resides at the client end and is usually a thin client (e.g. browser)</li>
<li>Tier 2 – This is called the middle tier, which consists of the Application Server.</li>
<li>Tier 3 – This is the 3rd tier which is backend servers. E.g., a Database Server.</li></ul>

<p><font size="5"><u><b> web security</b></u> refers to the protective measures and protocols that organizations adopt to protect the organization from cyber criminals and threats that use the web channel. Web security is critical to business continuity and to protecting data, users and companies from risk.<br>
Web security must be a critical priority for every organization. Along with email, the web is one of the top vectors for cyberattacks. The web and the use of DNS services specifically are part of 91% of all malware attacks, and email and web together are a key part for 99% of successful breaches.<br>
While the importance of web security is undisputed, protecting against web security threats grows more challenging each day. From thwarting attacks to dealing with limits in skills and resources, IT security departments face serious challenges when trying to secure the web.<br>
